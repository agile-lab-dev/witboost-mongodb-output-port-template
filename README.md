# MongoDB Output Port Template

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Usage](#usage)


## Overview

Use this template to define an Output Port exposing a MongoDB-hosted database, with integrated access control for both the database and its collections.

![Output Port Provisioning](docs/img/hld-Output-Port-Provisioning.png)

The MongoDB Output Port Template guides you through the configuration of a secure and well-defined Output Port for exposing data from a MongoDB instance.

- **Component Metadata**: Basic information such as name, description, domain, related Data Product, ownership, and tags.
- **Terms & Conditions and SLA**: Define usage policies, data refresh interval, timeliness, and availability.
- **Data Sharing Agreement**: Specify governance details including purpose, billing, security, usage, limitations, lifecycle, and confidentiality.
- **Subcomponent Definitions**: Configure one or more MongoDB collections by providing their name, description, and an optional JSON Schema for validation.

### What's a Template?

A Template is a tool that helps create components inside a Data Mesh. Templates help establish a standard across the organization. This standard leads to easier understanding, management and maintenance of components. Templates provide a predefined structure so that developers don't have to start from scratch each time, which leads to faster development and allows them to focus on other aspects, such as testing and business logic.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p1_user/p6_advanced/p6_1_templates#getting-started).

#### Skeleton Entities

Introduced in **Witboost 2.3**, Skeleton Entities provide a more dynamic and user-friendly approach to define systems and components. They seamlessly integrate with tools like the Editor Wizard and the Reverse Provisioning Wizard, allowing for easier entity management.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p3_tech/p12_catalog/p12_2_skeleton_entities).

The template uses this new feature. The old version of the template, that generates instead [Legacy Entities](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p3_tech/p12_catalog/p12_2_skeleton_entities/#skeleton-vs-legacy-entities), can be found in this same repository in the branch `release/v1`.

### What's an Output Port?

Output ports are one of the main components for the Data Mesh data platform taxonomy. They allow exposing the Data Product information to users using a well annotated and structured port, as well as handling access control.


### MongoDB

MongoDB is a general-purpose, document-oriented NoSQL database designed for high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.

MongoDB combines the power of traditional relational databases with the flexibility of modern NoSQL architectures. It is designed to handle large volumes of structured and unstructured data, making it ideal for a wide range of applications â€” from real-time analytics to content management and IoT.

For example, MongoDB supports powerful indexing and querying capabilities, dynamic schemas, and horizontal scalability through sharding. Its architecture also enables high availability through replica sets and built-in fault tolerance.

MongoDB provides the foundation for building modern, cloud-native applications that need to process and serve massive amounts of data in real time. It is widely used across industries for its developer-friendly model and operational simplicity.

- MongoDB includes the following key capabilities:
- Flexible, document-based data model
- Powerful query language and secondary indexes
- Horizontal scalability with sharding
- High availability with replica sets
- Integrated aggregation framework for analytics
- Rich ecosystem of drivers and tools
- Cloud-native experience with MongoDB Atlas

## Usage

To get information on how to use this template, refer to this [document](./docs/index.md).


### Component Testing

To verify the component before deploying it along with the Data Product, the component needs to be tested against a CUE Policy defined for [MongoDB Output Port](./policies/mongodb.cue). This policy needs to be defined inside the **Governance** section of the Witboost Platform.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p1_user/p5_managing_policies/p5_1_overview/).
