## Overview

Use this template to automatically create a MongoDB Output Port.

### What's a Output Port?

Output ports are one of the main components for the Data Mesh data platform taxonomy. They allow exposing the Data Product information to users using a well annotated and structured port, as well as handling access control.


### MongoDB

MongoDB is a widely used, document-oriented NoSQL database designed for modern applications that require scalability, flexibility, and high performance. It stores data in BSON (a binary form of JSON), enabling a schema-less structure that adapts easily to changing requirements. Key features include:

- Flexible Data Model: Documents can have varying structures, making it ideal for evolving application needs.

- High Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling via sharding, allowing the database to grow with your application.

- High Availability: Replica sets provide redundancy and automatic failover to ensure data durability and uptime.

- Rich Query Language: Includes powerful filtering, aggregation, and indexing capabilities.

- Security: Offers built-in authentication, authorization, and encryption options for secure deployments.

- Cloud-Native: MongoDB Atlas provides a fully managed version across major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
